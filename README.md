### My training project for EPAM

[![checks](https://github.com/incx07/epam-lab/actions/workflows/checks.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/incx07/epam-lab/actions/workflows/checks.yml/) [![build](https://github.com/incx07/epam-lab/actions/workflows/build-docker.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/incx07/epam-lab/actions/workflows/build-docker.yml/)

There is my training Django-project.

The project's goal is:

* create a web service (RESTful) for CRUD operations;
* create a simple web application (the web application should use the aforementioned web service for storing data and reading them from the database).
